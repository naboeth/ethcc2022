Project Description:

We want to create a dApp that is focused on crypto-incentives with a "Cook-to-Earn" mindset. The more you cook, the more you earn. In this dApp we ask people to cook their own meals at home in exchange for a little cryptocurrencies. The goal is to use blockchain technology to ensure transparency, trust and traceability while encouraging people to have healthier diets and living habits, and share the love for great food.

We will use smart contracts timelocks.
(We can use DAO for cooking competition with people voting for the best meal picture)***
(We could later support blockhain-based supply chain management retailers that could provide the ingredients)***

Recipes come from professional cooks or honorable amateurs who put their recipes as NFTs on the dApp. (People can buy the NFT recipes and collect them)***
We have a database of original recipes, ingredient lists, cooking instructions, pictures, etc.

In order to verify that people actually cook and eat their meals from home, we use:
- AI detection and recognition of the meal to compare it with original pictures from the recipe owners
- EFIX, IPTC and XMP metadata of pictures to verify the picture orginin and characteristics (+ check for any editing/photoshoping)
- We use a simple code generator and ask people to handwrite the code and take a picture of both the meal and the code written. An AI will also detect and find out if the code is the one sent to the user.

We believe those three verification steps should ensure a satisfactory amount of fraud detection.
(We could also develop a "Proof-ofCook" protocol based on community voting.)***

On top of that, if someone fails to cook a meal, the incentive can go to a food sustainability or hunger-fighting NGO.
